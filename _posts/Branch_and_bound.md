In this post, I'll be talking about the branch and bound technique, which is a general algorithm design paradigm for solving optimization problems. The main idea is to divide the problem into smaller subproblems, solve them recursively, and then combine the solutions to get the final answer. Because this can be computationally very expensive as the problem size grows, a key technique is to maintain a lower bound on the optimal solution to prune the search space, so that we don't waste time exploring regions of the search space that can't possibly contain the optimal solution.
