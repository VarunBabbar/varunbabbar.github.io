<div style="text-align: justify">
Hi! I'm Varun Babbar, an ML Research Associate at JP Morgan. I focus on developing machine learning models that can accelerate software development by providing insights about source code.
<!-- 
Here, I've deployed a weakly supervised learning model for providing code insights to developers and worked on a research project involving parameter-pruning of deep learning models. -->
<!-- Here, I also founded an interpretable ML reading group that focuses on knowledge sharing through talks and paper discussions.  -->

<div style="text-align: justify"> 
I graduated from the University of Cambridge in 2022 with a BA + MEng in Information and Computer Engineering, ranking in the top 5% of my class. During my time at Cambridge, I've collaborated with <a href='https://umangsbhatt.github.io/'> Umang Bhatt </a> and <a href='https://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/adrian/'> Adrian Weller </a> on human-aligned uncertainty quantification and risk control, <a href='https://sjmoran.github.io/'> Sean Moran </a> on federated learning for Covid-19 diagnosis, and <a href='https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rkm38/'> Rafal Mantiuk </a> on developing visual loss functions for image to image translation models.

Research Interests
======
------
<div style="text-align: justify"> 

My research interests lie broadly in trustworthy AI and human-machine collaboration. I am also excited by applications of learning algorithms in cost sensitive domains such as healthcare and criminal justice. Given constraints and feedback on a model provided by external stakeholders, I want to design algorithms that are maximally reliable / performant under the constraint set.

<div style="text-align: justify"> 
In an era where a major yardstick of progress in machine learning is performance on standardized benchmarks, it is important to ask whether these models ultimately facilitate robust decision making by humans. High model performance does not always guarantee high reliability. Here are some concerns (that barely scratch the surface of trustworthy ML):

1. <div style="text-align: justify"> A model can exhibit disparate impact on racial minorities when predicting the probability of recidivism in criminals. </div>
2. <div style="text-align: justify"> Heavily parameterized models (or very deep decision trees) are not very interpretable. How do we know if the model is using spurious features in input data to diagnose patients? </div>
<!-- To this end, a lot of [research]() is being done on developing explanation methods for vision and language applications that are fair, robust, and have high fidelity.  -->
3. <div style="text-align: justify"> Is the model sensitive to changes in inputs? Surely if I increase my credit card spending by 5%, my credit score shouldn't change a whole lot? </div>

<div style="text-align: justify"> <b> I love basketball and squash</b>: I was part of Cambridge's Varsity squash team. We toured a lot in and around Cambridgeshire, playing against county clubs and university teams alike. I don't play basketball regularly, but I watch and follow NBA basketball (i.e. Lakers) quite religiously. </div>


<!-- Create content & metadata
------
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).

<!-- **Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the academicpages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.
